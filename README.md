# data-breach-monitor

Developing a real-time data breach monitoring tool requires integration with existing data breach databases or APIs. One well-known service for checking compromised email addresses is "Have I Been Pwned" (HIBP). This example will use the HIBP API to create a basic version of a monitoring tool. Note that if you want to use the HIBP API, you would typically need to subscribe to it and handle API keys securely.

Below is a Python program that checks if an email address is part of any known data breaches using the HIBP API:

```python
import requests
import time

# Replace with your actual API key from Have I Been Pwned
HIBP_API_KEY = 'your_hibp_api_key'

def check_breach(email):
    """
    Check if the given email address is in a data breach using the HIBP API.
    
    Args:
        email (str): The email address to check.
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of breaches the email has been found in.
    """
    headers = {
        'hibp-api-key': HIBP_API_KEY,
        'User-Agent': 'Data Breach Monitor'
    }
    
    url = f'https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/breachedaccount/{email}'
    
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        
        # Handle different HTTP response statuses
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print(f"Breach found for email: {email}")
            return response.json()  # Return a list of breaches
        elif response.status_code == 404:
            print(f"No breaches found for email: {email}")
            return []  # No breaches found
        elif response.status_code == 401:
            print("Unauthorized. Check your API key.")
        else:
            print(f"Error: Received unexpected status code {response.status_code}")
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Network error occurred: {e}")

    return []

def monitor_emails(email_list, check_interval=3600):
    """
    Monitors a list of emails for any new data breaches.

    Args:
        email_list (list): A list of email addresses to monitor.
        check_interval (int): Interval in seconds between successive checks.
    """
    while True:
        for email in email_list:
            breaches = check_breach(email)
            if breaches:
                for breach in breaches:
                    print(f"Alert! {email} was found in the breach: {breach['Name']}")
        
        # Wait for the specified interval before checking again
        print(f"Waiting for {check_interval} seconds before next check...")
        time.sleep(check_interval)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # List of email addresses to monitor
    emails_to_monitor = ['user1@example.com', 'user2@example.com']

    try:
        monitor_emails(emails_to_monitor)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Monitoring stopped by user.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

### Important Considerations

1. **API Key Management**: Always keep your API key secure and do not hard-code it in production code. Consider using environment variables or a secure vault.

2. **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of the API provider's rate limits. The above tool checks at a regular interval (default is set to one hour) but you may need to adjust this based on your specific needs and the rate limits of the HIBP API.

3. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented here, but you’ll want to expand on this for production use, especially around network issues and API rate limits/errors.

4. **Security**: Always use HTTPS and authenticate properly with the API. Keep your code up to date with security updates.

5. **Privacy Concerns**: Take privacy implications into account when monitoring users' emails for breaches. Consider informing them about the tool’s operation and getting their consent.

By using this script, you should be alerted whenever one of the monitored email addresses turns up in a newly detected data breach, provided you have appropriately set the API key and are managing network connections securely.
